# Final Examination Schedule - Fall 2008

This project is a simple **HTML table** that replicates a final examination schedule for Fall 2008. The table includes four days of exam timings for different subjects, with a **"HOME"** section spanning across all rows in the last column. The table is styled using basic CSS and centered horizontally and vertically on the page using Flexbox.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file with internal CSS to style the table. The table contains:

- Headers for days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday).
- Exam subjects for each time slot (8:00 a.m., 10:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., and 3:00 p.m.).
- A special "HOME" cell that spans all rows in the last column.

## Features

- The table is **centered** both horizontally and vertically on the webpage using Flexbox.
- The **"HOME"** cell spans across multiple rows using the `rowspan` attribute in HTML.
- **CSS** is used to style the table, with colors and borders that make it easy to read.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Used to create the table structure.
- **CSS3**: Used to style the table, center it, and apply colors to the headers, rows, and "HOME" cell.
